# Password Generator

- Overview of the project:

  
The Password Generator is a Python script designed to create secure, random passwords of varying lengths. It is a useful tool for generating strong passwords that can enhance the security of accounts and systems. The script ensures that passwords contain a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to meet typical security requirements.
- Key Features:

  
Random Password Generation: The script produces a password with a random combination of characters to enhance security.
Customizable Length: Users can specify the exact length of the password they need.
Input Validation: The script validates the user input to ensure that the password length is a positive integer, and provides feedback for invalid inputs.
- How It Works:

  
Character Pool: The script uses a diverse set of characters, including:

Uppercase Letters: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Lowercase Letters: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Digits: 0123456789

Special Characters: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~`


- Password Generation:

The generate_password(length) function creates a password of the specified length by randomly selecting characters from the defined pool.
User Interaction:

The script prompts the user to enter the desired password length.
It validates the input to ensure it is a positive integer and greater than zero.
After generating the password, the script displays it to the user.
- Use Cases:

  
Account Security: Generate strong passwords for online accounts, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
System Access: Create secure passwords for system or application access where password strength is critical.
Testing: Useful for developers needing to generate sample passwords for testing purposes.
